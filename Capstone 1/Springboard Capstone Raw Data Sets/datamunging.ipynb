    "Not shown here, I did a couple checks to insure that the tables didn't inflate such as len(player_data_2014) and len(player_data_dict['PlayerSeasonTotals2014SIndCounts']) to make sure that there wasn't inflation there. I found exactly one that did increase due to a name capitalization item that I manually fixed. In fact this is the most common problem I've found in hockey data, which is with players coming from multiple nationalities there are a lot of interpritations of how to spell a name (Ales Hemsky is frequently Alex Hemski for example) so joining across platforms gets very tricky. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after some deliberation, I decided that I would not add suffixes to the values of the first table, Standard Independant counts, because otherwise the power play table would stand as the item of record as far as things like Position, Games Played, etc. The main problem here is Natural Stat Trick would record 0 games played if a player had not had a power play shift or the like, which created a number of NA values that shouldn't have been.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the specialty nature of this data set there are few na values. The notable exception is Draft information, as a number of players were undrafted. After consideration, I decided to make this a number higher than possible, 1000, which would make it stand out and be important for a linear regression, where as if I make it say, 0, it would be decidedly right by 1, which is the ideal draft ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Draft Year I made into 1900, and team is now 'Undrafted'. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as other missing values, Instead of writing out the reasoning for each fill here, I'll explain thusly: if the value is a count or a percentage of a count, I entered it as zero. If it's a percentage of a rate, then I filled to median. Example of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) IPP is Individual Point Percentage, the percentage of goals for that player's team while that player is on the ice that the player earned a point on. For this I filled the NA to 0, becuase logically if you have no points in this category your count would be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) OffZoneStartPer is Offensive Zone Start Percentage. this is a rate, and thus, simply hasn't been calculated since the player hasn't been given the opportunity to have such a stat created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence the logic here is \"if you have a NA due to not getting any points, you are marked zero, if you have an NA due to not being on the ice for that metric, you are returned to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another alternative which is I found some pointless columns (power play position, etc) which I dropped wholesale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I did a lot of manual iterations of printing out the list of over the 181 columns with missing values and changing each. while I've retained the fill in code below I'm deleting the boring iteration of making a list of the columns with na, then printing that list. Instead I've saved the fill segment. "
