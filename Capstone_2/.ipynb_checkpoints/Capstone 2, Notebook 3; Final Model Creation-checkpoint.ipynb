    "### Final Model Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover the building of a machine learning pipeline to cover how the final product was tested and trained. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the prior segments the data was compiled and examined to verify the shape and importance of the features on daily fantasy points. In the second segment, we created many moving averages to test out the theory that stock forecasting techniques could be effectively applied the forecasting of a players' performance. While that did have some validity, it was not significant enough to be the only method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This segment is to document the creation of a number of new models from the compiled data. The pipeline utilized three models: Stochastic Gradient Descent, random forests, and xgboost. "

Backwards looking analysis on the feature set was performed first using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to see if the values had high multicolinearity. \n",

In that case this would eliminate 208 of 228 values, including many that we've seen as highly valuable in the past: TOI over the last ten games ends up at 601, and TOI over the last 20 is at an astounding 4993. \n",

In order to try and trim the features in a more sensable way, the VIF was re-run removing both short handed events AND the averages for the last 10 games. Last 10 was isolated because last 20 shows a global number, while last 5 was effective in calculating "
