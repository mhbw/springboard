    "### Final Model Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover the building of a machine learning pipeline to cover how the final product was tested and trained. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the prior segments the data was compiled and examined to verify the shape and importance of the features on daily fantasy points. In the second segment, we created many moving averages to test out the theory that stock forecasting techniques could be effectively applied the forecasting of a players' performance. While that did have some validity, it was not significant enough to be the only method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This segment is to document the creation of a number of new models from the compiled data. The pipeline utilized three models: Stochastic Gradient Descent, random forests, and xgboost. "

    "Perhaps most problematic is that a rebalance using only this metric would leave us relying heavily on short handed events, that is, how teams play when they are penalized. Cutting at VIF<10 would leave 36 values, 17 of which are related to Short Handed events, cutting at VIF<=5 would leave 15 values, 6 of which are short handed. \n",

    "The problem with this is that Short Handed play is a relatively low percentage of the game, and short handed points are extremely isolated, and the scoring in this format does not add additional points for scoring in this manner. In order to try and trim the features in a more sensable way, the VIF was re-run removing both short handed events AND the averages for the last 10 games. Last 10 was isolated because last 20 shows a global number, while last 5 was effective in calculating "
